        "with metadata. The Bulgarian National Corpus  was first compiled using the Bulgarian Lexicographic Archive "
        "and the Text Archive of Written Bulgarian, which account for 55.95% of the corpus. Later, the EMEA corpus "
        "(medical administrative texts) and the OpenSubtitles corpus (film subtitles) were added, accounting for "
        "1.27% and 8.61% of the BulNC, respectively. The remaining texts were crawled automatically and include a "
        "large number of administrative texts, news from monolingual and multilingual sources, scientific texts, and "
        "popular science. The BulNC is not fully downloadable due to the inclusion of copyrighted material. We've "
        "provided a link to a password-protected archive for evaluation."
