## Bulgarian National Corpus

|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Title:**            | Bulgarian National Corpus            |
| **Description:**      | The Bulgarian National Corpus contains a wide range of texts in various sizes, media types (written and spoken), styles, periods (synchronic and diachronic), and licenses. Each text in the collection is supplied with metadata. The Bulgarian National Corpus  was first compiled using the Bulgarian Lexicographic Archive and the Text Archive of Written Bulgarian, which account for 55.95% of the corpus. Later, the EMEA corpus (medical administrative texts) and the OpenSubtitles corpus (film subtitles) were added, accounting for 1.27% and 8.61% of the BulNC, respectively. The remaining texts were crawled automatically and include a large number of administrative texts, news from monolingual and multilingual sources, scientific texts, and popular science. The BulNC is not fully downloadable due to the inclusion of copyrighted material. We've provided a link to a password-protected archive for evaluation.      |
